I am a research engineer at **OMRON SINIC X** working on **robot learning** project.
I received the B.Sc. Degree in information engineering from the **University of La Sabana**, Colombia, in 2013, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degree in engineering science from **Osaka University**, in 2019 and 2022, respectively. 

I worked on joint research projects with **Fujifilm** from 2018 to 2022 on topics related to robotic assembly automation with compliance control. I also researched about robot manipulation as an intern at **OMRON SINIC X** from 2021 to 2023. 

I participated as contributor in the 2022 [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/mpusZVc2) program with the open source organization **MoveIt**.
